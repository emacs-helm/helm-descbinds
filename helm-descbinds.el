;;; Commentary:
;; This package is a replacement of `describe-bindings' for Helm.

;; Usage:
;; 
;; You can use this package independently from Helm - in particular,
;; you don't need to turn on `helm-mode' to be able to use this.  Helm
;; just needs to be installed.
;;
;; Add followings on your .emacs.
;;
;;   (require 'helm-descbinds)
;;   (helm-descbinds-mode)
;;
;; or use customize to set `helm-descbinds-mode' to t.
;;
;; Now, `describe-bindings' is replaced with `helm-descbinds'. As
;; usual, type `C-h b', or any incomplete key sequence plus C-h , to
;; run `helm-descbinds'.  The bindings are presented in a similar way
;; as `describe-bindings ' does, but you can use completion to find
;; the command you searched for and execute it, or view it's
;; documentation.
;;
;; In the Helm completions buffer, you match key bindings with the
;; Helm interface:
;;
;;  - When you type RET, the selected candidate command is executed.
;;
;;  - When you hit RET on a prefix key, the candidates are narrowed to
;;    this prefix
;;
;;  - When you type TAB, you can select "Execute", "Describe" or "Find
;;    Function" by the menu (i.e. these are the available "actions"
;;    and are of course also available via their usual shortcuts).
;;
;;  - When you type C-z (aka "persistent action"), the selected
;;    command is described without quitting Helm.

You complete against a list of keys + command pairs presented in
a similar way as `describe-bindings' does, split into sections
defined by the types of the key bindings (minor and major modes,
global bindings, etc).

The default action executes a command as if the binding had been
entered, or narrows the commands according to a prefix key,
respectively.

The persistent action pops up a help buffer for the selected
command without quitting.

For key translation maps, the default actions are not very
useful, yet they are listed for completeness."
